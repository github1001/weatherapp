# weatherapp
The app aims to check the weather using an API end point

# Get started
Firstly do a npm install at the root folder, then do the same in the frontend directory

Then do a npm start, to run server and an npm start in the front end directory to run the application

# Challenges
I couldn't grab the JSON data via the given url for whatever reason so I resorted to using pastebin. 
I really hope that services or perhaps business will provide essential API with documented interoperability in the future just like pastebin.
I am still learning react so, most of the time it's just seeing what works and not. There are new syntactical changes like the use of hooks that I am getting use to.

# Happiness
Well, at least now you know when it's sunny or rainy
